# Color Detection and Registration System

This project combines a color detection system using OpenCV and a registration page with voice input capabilities using Tkinter and speech recognition.

## Features

- **Color Detection**: Captures live video from the webcam, detects the color of the center pixel, and provides voice feedback about the color.
- **Registration Page**: Allows users to register with a username and password via text or voice input.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to install the following Python packages:

- `opencv-python` (for video capture and color detection)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)
- `pandas` (for handling CSV files)
- `pyttsx3` (for text-to-speech functionality)
- `speech_recognition` (for voice input)
- `tkinter` (for creating the graphical user interface)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
opencv-python
numpy
pandas
pyttsx3
speech_recognition
tk
```

Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

1. **Prepare the CSV File**: Ensure you have a `colors.csv` file in the same directory as the script. The CSV file should have columns for color name, hex code, and RGB values.

2. **Run the Code**: Execute the script using Python.

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your script file.

## Usage

1. **Registration Window**: The registration window will appear first, allowing you to enter a username and password either by typing or using voice input.
   - To use voice input, click the "Use Voice Input" button and follow the prompts.
   - To use text input, enter your details in the fields and click "Register."

2. **Color Detection**: After registration, the color detection window will open.
   - The webcam feed will be displayed, showing the detected color of the center pixel.
   - Voice feedback will be provided about the detected color at regular intervals.

3. **Exit**: Press the 'q' key to exit the color detection window.

## Notes

- Ensure that your microphone and webcam are properly connected and working.
- Adjust the parameters in the code if necessary, such as frame rate or text-to-speech update interval.

## Troubleshooting

- **Module Not Found Error**: Ensure all required packages are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Microphone Issues**: Check your microphone settings and permissions.
- **Webcam Issues**: Verify that your webcam is properly connected and accessible.
